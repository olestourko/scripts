##About

Sometimes its an advantage to archive prank callsh from Youtube, because the admins will occasionally tear down videos. I don't know why it happens sir.

This is basically a wrapper for youtube-dl. It reads channel URLs from a JSON file.

##Requires
- python 2 or python3  
- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/)
